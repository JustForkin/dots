# -P pdf:
# 	send output to printer named pdf. This works directly in cygwin. In

# 	https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfwriterformac/, and follow
# 	instructions in the README.pdf file to add a new printer using name
# 	"pdf" instead of "PDFwriter" (default), and using the ppd file:
# 	/Library/Printers/Lisanet/PDFwriter/pdfwriter.ppd The output pdf file
# 	is saved in /Users/Shared/PDFwriter/username/
