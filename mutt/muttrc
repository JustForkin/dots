# contacts

# one can directly communicate with google contacts from the command line, eg.
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/goobook/ (python) and
# http://piao-tech.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-contacts-in-mutt.html (Ruby)
# or export selected contacts from google contacts to outlook or vCard formats
# and then use some scripts to convert them to abook format, eg.
# https://code.google.com/p/gmail-abook-contact-converter/
# goobook does not work for me because the password sent to google cannot be 
# recognized. The last script worked, but it dumps contacts to stdout. If I pipe
# it to a file, error happens.

# overwrite default create-alias key a:

# add new key M:
